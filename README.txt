This repository contains my entry in Ludum Dare 28, a 48 hour game programming competition.  The theme for this game jam was "You only get one."  As a participant in the event, I was tasked with designing and coding a game from scratch within a strict 48 hour period.  This was the first time I have participated in such an event and I had a fun time with it.  While this game is far from polished, I am quite proud of it.
